# Poem-Classification
# Poem Classification using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on classifying poems into different categories based on their textual content. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques are used to preprocess text data, extract features, and build classification models.

## Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess poem text  
- Convert text into numerical features using vectorization techniques  
- Train machine learning models for classification  
- Evaluate model performance  

##  Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- NLTK  
- Scikit-learn  
- CountVectorizer / TF-IDF  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
